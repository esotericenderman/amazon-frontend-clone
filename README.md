> A project I did to learn how to use HTML, CSS, and JavaScript together.

I followed a [YouTube course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SBmSRK3feww) by [SuperSimpleDev](https://www.youtube.com/@SuperSimpleDev). I recommend the course to anyone who wants to learn how to use HTML, CSS and JS together.

This project is non-functional, unfinished and has been abandoned.
